                                    Hunger is a symptom of poverty. Currently, a large amount of people in Bangladesh
                                    lives under the national poverty line. Poverty diminution is and was always the core challenge for Bangladesh.

                                <p style="text-align:justify">
                                    Of the 1.3 billion people who live in absolute poverty around the globe, 70% are women. For these women, 
                                    poverty does not just equal dearth and paucity. Bangladesh fosters
                                    a highly patriarchal culture and such gender discrimination is prevalent 
                                    among not only the poor, but in all community levels.

                                    Three major factors that affect the rates of death and disease in children in Bangladesh are injury, malnutrition
                                    and health, including arsenic contamination of the water supply and HIV/AIDS. Physical wellbeing comes before all else.

                                    Environmental sustainability is all the more vital in the
                                    context of Bangladesh because its environment is at an ever-precarious state.
                                    This is not only because of the rate of destruction of its biophysical resources and ecosystems, but also because of a rise in sea level
                                    due to global warming that puts approximately 17% of the southern region of Bangladesh under water by the year 2100.

                                    A community cannot be alleviated unless they themselves help in the process. The same holds true for all the local
